My name is Carter Pape. I am studying Computer Science and Mathematics at North Carolina State University, where I will graduate with the class of 2018.

There are a few people who have made things that allow this website to happen.

* [Github](https://github.com) is the host.
* [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com) made [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is the car battery that drives this Tesla.
* [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com) made [the theme](https://mademistakes.com/work/hpstr-jekyll-theme/) I've modified.
* I take some blogging and web development cues from [John Gruber's website](http://daringfireball.net).

Because of the generosity of these groups and people, I am licensed to use the things they have made—in the ways that I am using them—for free.

Having personal websites can be a time-consuming thing. You can perhaps tell by the number of posts and the frequency of my updates here that this is not the case for  me. I have this website because it's nice to have and maintain (even if infrequently). I don't take it too seriously.

Feel free to police my grammar and [tell me](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19Q3QpoSNBT4IWoQ1d1umCOBJtBm3xwNXTOylre6LKus/viewform) the mistakes I have made if you spot any.

If you want to read the personal website of someone who posts more than me, check out [my roommate's site](http://reesjones.github.io).
