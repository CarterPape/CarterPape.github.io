My name is Carter Pape. I am studying Computer Science and Mathematics at North Carolina State University, where I will graduate with the class of 2018.

Having personal websites can be a time-consuming thing, but not for me. This is probably obvious from the number of posts and the frequency of updates. I have this because it's nice, and costs me very little. I don't take it very seriously, and nor should you. It's a fun project, but not a serious one.

If you want to read the personal website of someone who posts more regularly, check out [my roommate's site](http://reesjones.github.io).

On an unrelated note, feel free to police my grammar and [tell me](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19Q3QpoSNBT4IWoQ1d1umCOBJtBm3xwNXTOylre6LKus/viewform) the mistakes I have made if you spot any.
