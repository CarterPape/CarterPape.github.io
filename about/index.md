So you want to see me talk about myself, eh? Fine. This monkey will dance for you.

I was born in the city of Durham, North Carolina.[^1] I am a student at North Carolina State University. I am pursuing degrees in both Computer Science and Mathematics. It is my second year at this fine institution, and yes, I do love it here.

I started programming around the age of thirteen. My first language was LabVIEW because that was the language that my father was using at the time for his job and in his free time. My journey of beginning to program is a story that I really love, so I'll save it for a separate post.

I love making art, but I have a hard time realizing[^3] the images in my head when freehand drawing, so I use GIMP and create stencils.

Every winter, I wear swim trunks on the first day for which snow is forecast in my area.[^2] It kind of riles up the weather. It's all like, "Oh, so he thinks I won't? Then I gUESS I WILL."

I once choked on a protein bar because I was literally running to take an exam.

I am the grammar police, so feel free to police my grammar and [tell me](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19Q3QpoSNBT4IWoQ1d1umCOBJtBm3xwNXTOylre6LKus/viewform) the grammar mistakes (and typos) I have made.

[^1]: My family has moved three times in my life, all within a five-mile radius of the hospital I was born. My move to Raleigh for college was the biggest move I have ever made. I'm just a regular nomad.

[^2]: I only count it if they are still forecasting snow as I wake up that morning.

[^3]: As in, "Give actual or physical form to". See definition 3 in Oxford Dictionary of English.
