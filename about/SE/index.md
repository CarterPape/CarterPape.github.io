My name is Carter Pape. I am studying Computer Science and Mathematics at North Carolina State University, where I will graduate with the class of 2018.

I grew up in Durham. I longboard to most of my classes. I'm really into art, so I'm taking a class on Impressionism. I'll be writing for the Technician this semester, as well as directing a play.

I've been programming since I was 13 and doing [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/progress=CarterPape) problems for most of the intervening time. I like Swift, so I made a [genetic algorithm framework](https://github.com/CarterPape/Basic-binary-genetic-optimization) with it.

[This is my calendar.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=crpape%40ncsu.edu&ctz=America/New_York) I would embed it if doing so didn't make this page look ugly. I run track, and practices are 5pm every weekday, but it's not on that calendar because it's semi-optional (I can run on my own time).
