> Tuesday night, NC State’s chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness hosted “You Are Not Alone,” an event whose purpose was to debunk myths of mental health. The Order of Omega, an honor society for Fraternity and Sorority Life members, co-sponsored the event, alongside Mary Chamblee, a mental health ambassador and senior studying communication.
