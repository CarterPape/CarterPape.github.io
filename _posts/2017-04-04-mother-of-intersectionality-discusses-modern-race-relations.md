I only contributed reporting to this one:

> Tuesday evening, students, faculty and staff filled the Piedmont-Mountains Ballroom in Talley Student Union to hear Kimberlé Crenshaw discuss intersectionality and race relations in America. Crenshaw’s lecture explored “intersectionality,” a term she coined in 1989, and how it relates to the #SayHerName campaign, which seeks to create visibility for the stories of black women who are killed by police.
