> Computer scientist Skylar Tibbits came to Stewart Theatre on Monday night to discuss the future of 3-D printing, materials science, self-assembling objects and many other technologies that he calls 4-D technology. The talk included an overview of how software has created the field he occupies at his Self-Assembly Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
