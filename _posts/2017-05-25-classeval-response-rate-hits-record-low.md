> The response rate to ClassEval, the end-of-semester survey that students are asked to fill out evaluating their professors and classes, has been declining each semester since fall 2014, reaching a four-year low in spring 2017. Data provided by the Office of Institutional Research and Planning (OIRP) also shows that response rates since 2013 have always been below 50 percent. Technician evaluated OIRPâ€™s* data for other significant trends.
