> Wednesday night, the Muslim Student Association held an art expo in Riddick Hearth, exhibiting art created by Muslim students. The art touched on contemporary issues facing Muslims, along with pieces inspired by Arabic writing, Middle Eastern architecture and Islamic traditions. Students also delivered spoken word pieces, and some spoke about their paintings.
