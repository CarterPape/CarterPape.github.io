> NC States reputation as a STEM-focused school is a source of pride for many students and faculty, but many feel that majors outside of science, math and engineering are not fairly recognized. Many believe the university has a reputation that emphasizes the strength of the engineering and science programs, but neglect the many departments and programs that do work in other disciplines, and of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences in particular.
