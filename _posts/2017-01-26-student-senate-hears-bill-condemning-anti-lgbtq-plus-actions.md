I wrote a news article for the Technician about the second Student Senate meeting of the semester, in which bills were heard pertaining to the condemnation of anti-LGBTQ+ actions (a reaction to [an event](http://www.technicianonline.com/news/article_b583d91c-e391-11e6-afef-b7abad9928ab.html) going on at the same time elsewhere in the building) and added senate seats for the Graduate School and Poole College of Management. Richard Linton, the dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, also spoke about the [Plant Sciences Initiative](https://cals.ncsu.edu/initiatives/plant-sciences-initiative/).
