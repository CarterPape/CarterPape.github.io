I wrote a news article for the Technician about recent programmer rankings that put NC State Computer Science students near the top of the nation (and world). I got takes from Ken Tate (Director of Development & External Relations for the Computer Science department) and David Sturgill (CSC professor who teaches a class in competitive problem solving).
