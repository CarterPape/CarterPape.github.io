> In 2007, NC State University Dining partnered with Raleigh-area food truck vendors to bring new flavors and an alternative dining option to an underserved part of campus. Since then, the food trucks have had a regular weekday lunch schedule, showing up between Venture II-A and II-B on Centennial Campus.
