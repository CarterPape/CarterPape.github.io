> Beginning in fall 2017, all students, new faculty and new staff will be required to take training on Title IX that will promote awareness about interpersonal violence prevention, reporting and care. This development follows a trend of the U.S. Department of Education taking incremental steps toward broadening the definition of Title IX to include issues about reporting of interpersonal violence incidents.
