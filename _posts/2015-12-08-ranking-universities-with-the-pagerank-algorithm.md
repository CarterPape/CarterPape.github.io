Let me tell you a little something interesting about NC State's relevance to the world of academia.

Google uses something called the Pagerank algorithm on websites to rank them based on their relevance to whatever words you're searching. e.g. if you're looking for the best way to study chemistry, and lots of websites that talk about studying chemistry mention UCLA's website about studying chemistry, then UCLA's website will be near the top of the search results.

Researchers at the University of Franche-Comte in France have used that same Pagerank algorithm on Wikipedia pages to rank universities by how influential they are. Mentions of a university on certain pages increase that university's influence rating.

I've of course simplified their process, but this is a clever application of an important algorithm. According to their analysis, NC State is 865th on the list of universities from around the world.[^1] That's pretty low, at least by the standards I set for us.

Let me circle this around to why this matters to you. Why do you care about NC State's ranking on this obscure listicle?

This ranking is an indicator of how much weight your word carries out in the world. People know Oxford turns out some very wise people and important ideas. If you're from Oxford, people are going care about what you have to say. That's why Oxford is second on this list.

Imagine if NC State acquired that sort of credibility. People would treat the words out of your mouth like pure gold because you are the product of a university that does simply incredible work in your field of study.

The way to move up this list of influential universities is to make an impact in academia. The way to make an impact in academia is to create results. Creating results can only happen if you are truly knowledgeable in your field.

Go out this week, and the next, and reinforce all the things you've learned this semester. Make that wisdom second-nature. That's how we start moving up the list. That's how you start bringing you and our fine university the reputation we deserve: one that garners respect and admiration and that causes people to listen when you speak or write.

And if that's not enough for you, our friends in Chapel Hill are 89th on the same list. 750 positions above us. Maybe that competition is the thing that motivates you.
