## profile

I am a student journalist with extensive experience in web development and software engineering, priming me for working in the digital media environment. I have held leadership positions at NC State's student newspaper and radio station. I also have experience in data analysis and data mining, complemented by my undergraduate studies in mathematics and computer science.

## why reporting?
