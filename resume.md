## profile

I am a student journalist reporting on NC State and Raleigh news through my own digital media project, which I am producing as part of my NC State Honors capstone project.

I have extensive experience in web development and software engineering, priming me for working in the digital media environment. I also have experience in data analysis and data mining, complemented by my undergraduate studies in mathematics and computer science.

## why reporting?

I seek to capitalize on my experience in student journalism by assimilating into a reporting career. I aim to establish myself as a skilled, reliable reporter. I hope to report alongside professional journalists, editors, radio hosts, and others.
