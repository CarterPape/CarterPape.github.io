## profile

I am a reporter with work experience in newspaper journalism and software development. I have lived in North Carolina, Colorado, and now Utah.

I have done extensive web development and software engineering, priming me for working in the digital media environment. I have practiced data analysis and data mining in both academic and journalistic pursuits, all complemented by my undergraduate studies in mathematics and computer science.
