I received my [Part 107 certification](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/) in [May 2020](https://www.facebook.com/carter.pape.12/posts/887898078358898), certifying me to fly drones for commercial purposes. I have also since purchased my own drone, a [DJI Air 2S](https://www.dji.com/air-2s). As of June 2021, I have 17 hours of flight time.

I am looking to perform drone work for hire. If you are interested, [contact me]({% link contact.md %}).
