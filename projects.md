## Praeci

Praeci is a reporting project I am starting that will present NC State and Raleigh news with a focus on succinct writing and attractive presentation. I built the website myself using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

I have been customizing a template built by Artem Sheludko, adding custom layouts and elements. I have also built podcast RSS feed syndication, enabled by Amazon S3 for storage of podcast audio and by [PodTrac](http://analytics.podtrac.com) download analytics.

## Basic binary genetic optimization

This project was an excursion into genetic optimization. I built the original framework in Swift 2 to complete the simple task of genetically optimizing a data structure containing two floats to be as close as possible to a given pair of numbers. I later added a module that uses the genetic optimization to fit a polynomial of variable order to a set of points. I have also been updating the syntax to keep up with current Swift versions.

Swift is not the optimum language to use for such a project, but I was interested to learn the language at the same time that I first wanted to build a genetic optimization framework, so I used it anyway.
