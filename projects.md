## *write*

*write* is a digital notepad currently under development for macOS that provides focused, beautiful, and responsive word processing for web content writers. *write* responds to Markdown syntax, allowing writers and editors to see and do text formatting without lifting a finger from the keyboard. The app provides an environment for web content creation that is distraction-free and simple to use.

For more about *write*, read my [introduction][write introduction] to the [series of articles][write series] I am writing as I develop the app. You can also see the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/CarterPape/write).

## Praeci

Praeci is a reporting project I created for presenting NC State and Raleigh news with a focus on succinct writing and attractive presentation. I built the website myself using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

I customized a template built by Artem Sheludko, adding custom layouts and elements. I also built the site's podcast RSS feed syndication, enabled by Amazon S3 for storage of podcast audio and by [PodTrac](http://analytics.podtrac.com) download analytics.

## Basic binary genetic optimization

This project was an excursion into genetic optimization. I built the original framework in Swift 2 to complete the simple task of genetically optimizing a data structure containing two floats to be as close as possible to a given pair of numbers. I later added a module that uses the genetic optimization to fit a polynomial of variable order to a set of points. I have also been updating the syntax to keep up with current Swift versions.

Swift is not the optimal language for building this tool. However, I used Swift anyway because I was interested to learn the language at the same time that I was thinking about building a genetic optimization framework.
