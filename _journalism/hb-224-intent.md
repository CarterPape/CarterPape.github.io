This story assuaged fears that changes in August 2020 to Grand County's form of government might have been unlawful. Though a judge ruled on the county's form of government days before this story published, he avoided the core issue of whether the August amendments were legal.

Some Moabites feared that a follow-up lawsuit could force the county to adopt a three-person commission form --- a worst-case scenario for most locals, but a best-case scenario for some. That scenario has not manifested to date, and no such lawsuit has been brought.
