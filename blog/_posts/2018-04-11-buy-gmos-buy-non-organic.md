title: "buy GMOs, buy non-organic"
excerpt: "There's a lot of misunderstanding about what a GMO actually is and what the difference between organic and conventional farming is. Neither is as bad as you imagine."

While there’s nothing wrong with sometimes buying foods that are organic or not genetically modified (e.g. if it’s cheaper or other options aren’t available), people who make a point to purchase products with the "organic" and "non-GMO" labels are supporting fearmongering against biotechnology. This creates considerable opportunity costs for everyone because while organic farming may offer marginal environmental benefits and little else, non-GMO crops have nothing to offer in terms of health benefits, despite common perceptions.

Companies that use non-GMO or organic labels play on fears about other foods considered “unnatural” or containing “chemicals” and pesticides. This misleading marketing strategy perpetuates misinformation about the benefits and safety of genetically modified organisms and conventional farming methods.

These marketing strategies have created strong enough sentiments against genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that protest groups have [destroyed GMO crop research fields][Greenpeace protest] and [opposed efforts at growing golden rice][golden rice opposition], which has been shown to [fight vitamin A deficiency][golden rice research], a major cause of childhood blindness in parts of Asia.

Among the [many misconceptions about organic farming][Scientific American on organic] is a belief that organically farmed crops are healthier than conventionally farmed crops because of the pesticides used in each. [This has been disproven][Slate on organic].

In the United States, it is the job of the [Food and Drug Administration][FDA about page] (FDA) to create and enforce regulations that ensure all foods (conventionally farmed, organically farmed, GMO, and non-GMO) sold to American consumers are safe to eat. While not a perfect public protection, the FDA presents a considerable mitigating factor in preventing health risks posed by irresponsible or potentially harmful farming methodologies.

Arguments attempting to dismiss genetic modification as being unnatural miss the point that genetic transfer can and does occur naturally; [transgenesis][transgene], a common form of genetic modification, is what gives us the [sweet potato][potato article]. Additionally,

1. [Genetic engineering][genetic engineering wiki] is a breeding method, not an ingredient.

2. “Genetic modification,” while often used colloquially to mean genetic engineering, is a vague term that could just as easily be used to describe [selective breeding][selective breeding] methods. All animal and plant breeding—horse breeding, maize breeding and everything in between—would thus be considered genetic modification, as well.

3. Genetic engineering can be used as a tool to save nature ([papayas][papaya video], as an example) and feed the world by improving plants’ abilities to [survive in certain climates and environments][drought resistance].

4. While they may originate in a certain species, genes used in genetic engineering processes are not going to make a plant “part-fish” or “part-” anything else. [Genetic engineering is expensive][genetic engineering cost], and transferring anything other than the single beneficial trait or set of traits is irresponsible and inefficient, so it just doesn’t happen.

Support a scientifically sound approach to farming and biotechnology by putting your money where the science is, and ask others about the foods they buy.
