Soon after starting as a reporter with _The Times-Independent_ in January 2019, I began singlehandedly rebuilding the newspaper's website. The result won best in class against other Utah weeklies with circulations of 3,000 or more, including the [_Park Record_](https://www.parkrecord.com), [_Salt Lake City Weekly_](https://www.cityweekly.net), and [Emery TV News](https://etvnews.com).

I wrote about the successes of the website in [a blog post]({%- link the-blog/_posts/2020-06-15-moabtimes-com-wins-first.md -%}).
