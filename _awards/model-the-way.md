I won this award, part of an annual NC State's annual Wolfpack [Leadership Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leadership_Challenge) awards, after NC State's Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity learned about [Praeci]({% link apps.html %}#praeci) and wrote [a feature about the project](https://diversity.ncsu.edu/news/2017/11/30/diversity-community-intrigued-by-new-podcast-series/).

The competition class for this award is all nominated NC State students.
