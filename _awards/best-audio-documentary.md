This podcast episode reported the history of NC State's Division of Academic and Student Affairs, using interviews with several former and current officials from the division.

I learned during the reporting process that a key figure to DASA had recently died, so as a fair warning, the end of the episode is cringey.

The competition class for the award was national and based on nominations.
