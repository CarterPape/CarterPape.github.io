# photography

One facet of working for a newspaper with [fewer than 10 full-time staff members](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/happy-new-year-from-all-of-us-at-the-times-independent/) is that there are no staff photographers. I and my editor take the bulk of the newspaper's staff-sourced photos; community members, officials, and open license sources provide the rest.

I do not yet own a digital SLR, so most photos shown here were taken with an iPhone. My [drone photography]({% link drone-work.md %}) is even sharper.
