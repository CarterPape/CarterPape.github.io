<p>
I started out studying computer science and physics in college, and I began working in software development internships in college, so I have both the skills and interest to program.
</p>
<p>
Some of the projects shown here support the work I do as a reporter; some of it is an outlet for my programmer impulses; some of it is both.
</p>
<p>
    Here are some highlights of my completed and active projects.
