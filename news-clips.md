This page showcases my journalistic work. I have a separate list for my [completed and active programming projects]({% link projects.md %}), some of which directly supports my work in local journalism.

The following are works on which I was first or only author or producer. The list is meant to highlight the clarity and voice of my reporting, my eye for striking imagery, and my presence in podcast and radio productions.
