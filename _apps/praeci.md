Praeci [was](https://praeci.com/praeci-is-defunct) a reporting project I created for presenting NC State and Raleigh news with a focus on succinct writing and attractive presentation. I built the website myself using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

I customized a template built by Artem Sheludko, adding custom layouts and elements. I also built the site's podcast RSS feed syndication, enabled by Amazon S3 for storage of podcast audio and by [PodTrac](https://analytics.podtrac.com) download analytics.
