`moab.news` is basically a daily blog that I write for myself, my family, my close friends, and my boss.

It's a place for me to put draft stories, partial stories, lists of links, documents, and anything else I need or want to aggregate in the process of reporting.

It's also an outlet for formatting my own stories online. I don't get to control the look and feel of [*The Times-Independent*'s website](https://moabtimes.com), but I do get to control the look and feel of `moab.news`.

The editorial standards to which I hold myself on `moab.news` are [not the same](https://moab.news/what-is-this/) as the standards to which I hold myself in my actual reporting. I and my editor vet stories between when I put them on `moab.news` and when they are published in The Times-Independent.
