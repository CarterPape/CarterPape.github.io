[`moabtimes.com`](https://moabtimes.com) is _The Times-Independent_'s website. Prior to May 2020, I maintained the website after developing it myself and won and award for doing so.

Although the content on the site is protected by copyright, the source code from the previous iteration of the site (namely, the WordPress theme, called [RedRock](https://github.com/the-times-independent/RedRock)) has [an open source license](https://github.com/the-times-independent/RedRock/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

I had begun developing a paywall for the website to restrict access by non-subscribers via a monthly quota of free articles. The plugin, called [RedRock Subscriptions](https://github.com/the-times-independent/RedRock-Subscriptions), is built with [Memberful](https://memberful.com), and is based on [that company's own WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/memberful-wp/).
