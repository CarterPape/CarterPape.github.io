## Questions and answers on waiver-specific operational risks and mitigations

https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/part_107_waivers/waiver_safety_explanation_guidelines/media/WSEG_operational_risks_mitigations.pdf

1. **Describe how the Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) will be able to continuously know and determine the position, altitude, attitude, and movement of his/her small unmanned aircraft (sUA) or drone and ensure the sUA or drone remains in the area of intended operation without exceeding the performance capabilities of the command and control link.**
    1. When the RPIC or person operating the small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) or drone cannot see the sUA or drone, how will they know, at all times, the current real-time (1) geographic location, (2) altitude above the ground, (3) attitude (orientation, deck angle, pitch, bank), and (4) direction of flight of the sUA or drone?
    1. If the primary method of maintaining this awareness fails, how will the RPIC maintain current and accurate knowledge of this information?
    1. How will the RPIC determine the operational limits of the command and control link in the flight environment and at the location of flight?
1. **Describe how the RPIC will avoid other aircraft, flying over/into people on the ground, and ground-based structures and obstacles at all times.**
    1. How will the RPIC see and avoid, or detect and avoid, all other aircraft when operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS)?
        - *For example, actions taken or procedures followed by the RPIC, use of a Visual Observer(s) (VO), or use of equipment/technology.*
    1. How will the RPIC know the location(s) of other aircraft that may be at risk of hitting the sUA or drone?
    1. How will the sUA or drone yield the right-of-way to all aircraft, airborne vehicles, and launch and reentry vehicles as required by Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) § 107.37?
    1. When operating BVLOS, how will the RPIC identify and avoid flying over/into persons on the ground (as required by 14 CFR § 107.39)?

        1. What kind equipment/technology?
        1. How does it work?
        1. How is it tested to determine system reliability and limitations?

1. **Describe how the RPIC is alerted of a degraded sUAS or drone function.**
    1. When flying BVLOS, how will the RPIC be alerted if the sUAS or drone malfunctions or its capability degrades, and how will he/she respond?
