# A colleague and I wrote a series about Moab's housing crises.

This housing series kicked off with a novel angle into the housing issues that *The Times-Independent* had long been covering: [The impact on employers](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/moabs-housing-crises-create-a-hiring-crisis/). In planning the article, however, we realized that we had an opportunity to take a more rigorous and sweeping approach over the course of the coming weeks.

The next week, we covered existing plans to address affordable housing that the city and county [had been neglecting for years](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/roughly-half-of-moabs-2017-housing-plan-is-incomplete/). It was accompanied by [a piece by my colleague Sophia Fisher](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/what-more-can-be-done-for-housing/) about how cities similar to Moab were grappling with similar housing issues.

The next week was slower because of a holiday, so we keyed in on [two statistics](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/two-key-statistics-about-moabs-housing-crisis/) that helped tell the story of Moab's housing crises and explained their significance: The affordability gap, and the decline in multi-family housing locally.

The next week, we dug into [the city's and county's land use regulations](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/housing-is-moab-reaping-what-it-sowed/) to examine how they impacted the housing situation locally. We used a white paper produced by University of Utah researchers as a template to compare best practices with actual practices in Moab.

We closed the series by talking to local political leaders. Through the conversations, the conclusion that [Moab needs leadership to start addressing its housing issues](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/officials-say-moab-needs-leadership-on-housing/) became clear. It turned out the series and story were well-timed, as city mayoral and council elections were set to be held a few months later.
