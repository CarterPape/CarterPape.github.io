# Grand County is fighting homebuilders. Here's how I'm covering it.

When Grand County officials learned in late January that a local homebuilder was looking outside the valley for the money needed to enable new housing, it [set in motion](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/a-new-conflict-could-cost-grand-hundreds-of-new-homes/) a series of decisions that eventually led to the project getting derailed.

The essential question was this: Who is allowed to own homes built under the county's High-Density Housing Overlay ordinance? After [initial debate](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/county-holds-line-on-hdho-reading-tables-vote-on-rules/), the county eventually said that [only locals could buy them](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/against-developers-wishes-county-passes-hdho-rules/), despite authors of the ordinance saying that [anyone could buy them](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/a-former-county-staffer-challenges-official-hdho-narrative/), as long as locals lived in them.

Eventually, [it became clear](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/the-intent-of-the-hdho-is-now-clear/) (despite [some disagreement](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/confusion-abounds-over-hdho-debacle/)) that the county was wrong about the original intent of the ordinance. However, the letter of the law was a separate matter.

Homebuilders [took their case before a hearing officer](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/developers-appeal-their-hdho-case/), who indeed ruled that the intent of the ordinance was legally irrelevant because [the letter of the law was on the county's side](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/county-prevails-against-homebuilders/).

Now, one of the homebuilders who lost their appeal has said that they plan to appeal the decision to a judge. Today, that is where the story sits.
