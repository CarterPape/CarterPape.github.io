Here are some questions I've been thinking about lately:
- Is there something fundamentally wrong with the design of Facebook?
- How should Congress regulate social media companies?
- What protections should Americans expect when they go on the internet?
- Should I delete my Facebook account?

Every week during this series, I will present notes on something I'm reading—e.g. scientific research, a news article, an opinion piece—as I attempt to answer these questions and find more to ask. By the end, hopefully I will have laid out a blueprint for understanding Facebook and the larger ecosystem of social networking sites as I look deeply at the socioeconomic impacts of social media companies, and the threats and possibilities to humanity that they present.

Along the way, I will present context from adjacent fields and topics, including how Bitcoin works and is regulated, the mental health of children who frequently use websites like YouTube, what makes the design of Snapchat unique among social networking sites, and more.

Ideally, I will even conduct interviews and start doing original research and journalism by the end to add to the body of work surrounding Facebook and its practices.

I'm writing these posts as I conduct this work, so sometimes the posts will be short, abridged versions of my thoughts. Other days, they will be long and comprehensive. Only time will tell what are the best systems for writing, sorting, sharing these, but you're more than welcome to join for the ride.
