How Facebook works
The problem isn't how it works; the problem is they don't tell you

The problem is a lack of transparency

# Facebook knows what gets your attention

Facebook has lots of data that can inform them as they attempt to predict what kinds of content to which you'll respond.
Information available for collecting by Facebook:
    All ads you've ever seen, ignored, stared at, clicked, or otherwise interacted with
    All news feed content you've ever seen, ignored, stared at, liked, commented on, or shared
    All contents of all non-secret messages, pictures, videos, and links you've ever sent or received
    All events you've been invited to (even if you ignored or didn't attend them), marked as "attending", "interested", or "not going"
    If you have an Android phone, some phone calls you've made or received on the device
    Your full Facebook search history
    Some of your web browsing history

We know that Facebook collects and retains all of this information. The problem is that you are in direct control of only part of this data—your data—, and there may be more information that Facebook collects about you, but they have no legal obligation or market incentive to tell you. Telling you the totality of what they collect costs them strategic advantage; information is currency (which is why they collect so much about you), but in any way sharing the categories of data they collect gives competitors access to a key piece of the social media equation: how social media platforms figure out what gets your attention.

a well-kept secret that creates a commensalistic relationship between consumers and corporations

# Advertisers want your attention

They have brands they want to promote
They have products they want to sell
They want to build audiences
They want to attract customers
They want to be well-known
They have ideas they want to promote
They are candidates who want your vote
They are politically motivated
They want to influence your opinion
They want to spread information
They may even want to spread misinformation


## How advertisers are regulated

The motives of advertisers can be contrary to the wellbeing of consumers, which is why the Federal Trade Commission so heavily regulates advertisements in the United States (along with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Election Commission).
The reasons an advertiser might want to show you an ad are numerous. Ideally, these motives would be transparently available to any and all ad viewers the way the sponsor of American political ads must be disclosed in the advertisement itself.

### Federal Fair Housing Act

Makes it illegal to publish any advertisement “with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicated any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.”

# The need for independently regulating Facebook

privacy is a two-way road

anecdotal evidence about friends showing up in friends list when you mention them irl and is it because microphone pays attention? (Reply All)
two local diners showed up in my ad Remedy Diner showed up after we mentioned it as a possibility (but also I like their Facebook page)

FTC requires truth and disclosure from advertisers. Facebook is legally responsible if it makes false claims to consumers, but requiring disclosure is missing.
Privacy policies are only required in special circumstances. It may be market forces that have caused Facebook to provide a privacy policy, it may be industry standard... in any case, it does not give you full disclosure in the policy about...
