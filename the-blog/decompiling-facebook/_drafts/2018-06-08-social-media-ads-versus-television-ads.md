This story, [Should Facebook Ads Be Regulated Like TV Commercials?]({{ page.ext-link }})[^last-quote], comes from Elizabeth Dwoskin[^Dwoskin] of *The Atlantic* published September 14, 2017. I have added the emphases.

> Experts seem to agree on two principles with respect to free speech and tech company arbitration. First, social-media companies, like other private publishers and unlike the government, are not bound by the First Amendment—meaning that they have discretion over what kind of speech is allowed on their platforms. And second, it is dangerous for the government to play a role in censoring content and advertisements on social media—beyond requiring companies to ban illegal activity from their platforms.

> Further, many experts believe that _mandating the disclosure of political-advertisement sources on Facebook, like the requirement for television or radio to identify ad sponsors on air, could help solve the problem_. “Even if nothing else is done, it should be possible to require that political advertisers on Facebook embed the financing information in the ad, and it should be possible for Facebook to archive a copy of the ad with state elections officials or the FEC,” says Philip Howard, the director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute.

## prerequisites to running a political advertisement on Facebook or Twitter

Anybody who wishes to run political ads on Facebook must first provide the following:

- a scan of their drivers license or passport
- the last four digits of their Social Security Number[^test]
- a physical mailing address, to which Facebook sends a verification letter

Twitter has a similar certification process, but also asks for organizations' FEC registration numbers (if applicable).

[^test]: hello there.

The article was published seven months before Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg testified before House and Senate committees, and what is proposed in the second paragraph has been implemented at both [Twitter][Twitter political ads] and [Facebook][Facebook political ads] since the publishing of this article.

Dwoskin follows up later to say that lawmakers would need to define the degree to which social media companies like Facebook are responsible for verifying the identity of advertisers, but a quick read through the Facebook and Twitter rules regarding political advertising (which, again, were written months after this story was released) shows that the companies go to quite extensive lengths to verify identities.



*[FEC]: Federal Election Commission, which tracks and regulates campaign financing in the United States


[^Dwoskin]: I discovered embarrassingly late into writing this post that Dwoskin wrote [the last story I reviewed][WhatsApp post], as well. She's on a roll!

[^last-quote]:
    In the last paragraph of the story, Neil Richards, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, likens advertising to "a kind of mental pollution", which is an idea I've read about before, specifically from the [WhatsApp founders][WhatsApp hates ads], and will explore later in this series.
    
    Because of the historical nature and commonality of advertising, I wonder whether most people think of it as a "necessary evil". Is it just a thing people live with because that's what companies have to do to make money? Or is it a nuisance that nobody really knows how to eradicate?
    
    Refactored into more empirically testable questions: when people are given the opportunity to pay for ads to go away, how frequently do they choose to pay? How much will people pay to hide advertisements?
