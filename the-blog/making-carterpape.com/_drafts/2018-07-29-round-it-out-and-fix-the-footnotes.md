footnote backlinks make sense and don't appear as emoji on mobile.

all external hyperlinks open in a new tab without me needing to specify for each link

and noticed :target selector when I was linking to his GitHub comment

thought about adding footnote highlighting when the back-reference is clicked, maybe animating it so that it disappears, and I thought this might improve readability by showing the user where they left off. but it didn't feel right. if you click a footnote, the page will forever have some sort of highlighting on it until you hit the browser back button until there's no target in the url.
