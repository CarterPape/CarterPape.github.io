There are a few people who made things that allow this website to happen.

* [Github](https://github.com) is the host of the website.
* [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com) made [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is the car battery that drives this Tesla.
* [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com) made [the theme](https://mademistakes.com/work/hpstr-jekyll-theme/) I've modified for the site.
* I take a lot of cues for good blogging and web development practices from [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net).

Thanks to the generosity of all these groups and people, I am licensed to use the things they have made—in the ways that I am using them—for free. They are all very kind for doing these things.
